    "Conditional situations are actually situations that we constantly encounter in daily life. For example, we take our umbrella depending on whether the weather is rainy or sleep depending on how sleepy we feel. In fact, we encounter many conditional situations in programming. For example, we perform certain actions according to certain conditions, but not according to certain conditions. These form the basis of conditional situations. If you want, let's start writing conditional situations with **if** blocks."
